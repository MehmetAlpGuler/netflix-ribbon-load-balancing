## Ribbon & Eureka

##### Netflix Ribbon
The Ribbon mainly provides client-side load balancing algorithms. It is a client-side load balancer that provides control over the behavior of HTTP and TCP client. The important point is that when we use Feign, the Ribbon also applies.

#####Types of Load Balancing:
There are two types of load balancing

- **Server Side Load Balancing**: Server side load balancing is a monolithic It applies between the client and the server. It accepts incoming network, application traffic, and distributes the traffic across the multiple backend servers by using various methods. The middle component is responsible for distributing the client requests to the server.
- **Client-Side Load Balancing**: The client holds the list of serverâ€™s IPs so that it can deliver the requests. The client selects an IP from the list, randomly, and forwards the request to the server.
